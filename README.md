At the moment this is just a playground for a simple stream-based language
syntax; check back later for more interesting stuff.

## Compiling

If you want to play with the code, notice that it's only tested on GCC 4.8.1 at
the moment, and that won’t change very soon. At the very minimum it requires a
C++11 compliant compiler that’s on par with what GCC 4.8.1 offers, plus an
up-to-date Boost (1.53 or newer, although older versions might work).
